# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 03 January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Began working with C#, Unity and FCC

**Thoughts:** I've just begun so I don't know if I can legitimately start my own projects yet but I'm excited to start.

### Day 2: 04 January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Some more FCC and C#. Begun a project of my own. A profile site.

**Thoughts:** I've been thinking of taking a look at some Computer Science books. I want a deeper understanding of the theoretical so I can improve my practical skills.

### Day 3: 05 January 2016

**Today's Progress:** A little more work on FCC, up to bootstrap now. I've also done some wireframing work on my personal project. 

**Thoughts:** I had doubts as to whether or not wireframing was a waste of time. I think I underestimated it's usefulness. I'll probably be doing a little more of it from now on.

### Day 4: 06 January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on personal website for a while.

**Thoughts:** Personal website is evolving rapidly. I'm quickly learning what to do and what not to do.

### Day 4: 07 January 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on personal website for a very long while

**Thoughts:** I'm finding my place and the aesthetics I enjoy. Working on a project on your own without a tutorial is so important to find out what you enjoy doing.
