# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 03 January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Began working with C#, Unity and FCC

**Thoughts:** I've just begun so I don't know if I can legitimately start my own projects yet but I'm excited to start.

### Day 2: 04 January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Some more FCC and C#. Begun a project of my own. A profile site.

**Thoughts:** I've been thinking of taking a look at some Computer Science books. I want a deeper understanding of the theoretical so I can improve my practical skills.
